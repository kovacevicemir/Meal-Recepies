1. install redux, react-redux
2. create folders store -> reducers/actions
3. create meals reducer (or user reducer, or item reducer...)
	reducers/meals.js
	
	const mealsReducer = (state=initialState, action) =>{
		return state
	}
	
	_initialState_ is some data for example: [user1,user2]

4. Setup redux store in App.js (or whichever root file)
	import {createStore, combineReducers} from redux
	
	const store = createStore(+combinedReducers+)
	
5. Provide store to whole application
	import {provider} from 'react-redux'

	<Provider store={store}>--rootComponent--<Provider/>
	   _provider takes store property_

SO FAR THIS GIVES AS ACCESS TO STORE IN ANY: SCREEN, COMPONENT ETC.

6. USE/GET Store in components:

	import {useSelector /or/ connect} from react-redux
		_useSelector_ is for hooks only...

	const test = useSelector(state=>state.nameOftheReducer..)
        _useSelector is executed automatically by react-redux_
	_it returns any data/state we wants from it_
	_state is refering to combinedReducers all we have there_
